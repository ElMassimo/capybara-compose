# Capybara Test Helpers in Rails 🛤

This example app uses [__Capybara Test Helpers__][library]
to implement its integration tests.

It provides examples on how to write both Cucumber features and RSpec system specs.

Write tests that everyone can understand, and leverage your Ruby skills to keep them __easy to read and easy to change__.
